Dr. Smith's provided code limits the program from sending the same packet 10 times 
consecutively, not 10 times absolutely over the course of the program. With the case of 
sending the EOF packet from the server, it is limited to sending 10 times consecutively.
When processing to confirm that the client has ACK'ed any data preceding EOF, the 
retryCount of ten is reset if an ACK is received. 

To limit the sending of EOF to ten times absolutely over the course of the program requirescommenting out one line of code. However doing so with higher error percentage gurantees a timeout rather than a complete file transfer.
